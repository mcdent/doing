# doing
***
This is a simple script which can be run from the command line / cli to add a single entry
to your Obsidian Daily note. It is designed to be simple and fast for people working from their
Linux / MacOS terminal frequently. It also adds a tag to the entries so you can search them all.
It seperates each entry with a single line too, just to keep them tidy. A time stamp is added to the
start of your line so you can see when you started or completed a task.

You could create 2 (or more) copies of the script and have a different hashtag appended for
each. That way you could use `doingw` for work stuff, which adds #doing-work hashtag
and `doingh`, which adds the hashtag #doing-home. You can of course use hastags when you enter the
text from the commmand line.
Like I said it's simple and for me it serves a purpose to log something quickly to Obsidian.
USAGE:
`doing Adding the final touches to my plan for world domination!`
